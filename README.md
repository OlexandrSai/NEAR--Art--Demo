Project is using ```near-api-js``` to work with NEAR blockchain. In ``` /services/near.js ``` key classes, functions and configs are imported, they will be used to work with NEAR
```
import { keyStores, Near, Contract, WalletConnection, utils } from "near-api-js";
```
Then connecting to NEAR:
```
// connecting to NEAR
export const near = new Near({
    networkId: process.env.VUE_APP_networkId,
    keyStore: new keyStores.BrowserLocalStorageKeyStore(),
    nodeUrl: process.env.VUE_APP_nodeUrl,
    walletUrl: process.env.VUE_APP_walletUrl,
});

``` 
and creating wallet connection
```
export const wallet = new WalletConnection(near, "NCD.L2.sample--art-demo");
```
After this by using Composition API you will need to create ```useAuth()``` function and use inside ```signIn()``` and ```signOut()``` functions of wallet object. By doing this, login functionality can then be used in any component of the app. Also because this app has more then 1 view, it is added ``` watchEffect() ``` to ``` useAuth() ```, it is redirecting pushing user to ``` /dashboard ``` if ``` accountId ``` is not null (basically, if user is logged in) :
```
watchEffect(() => {
        if (accountId.value) {
            router.push('/dashboard')
        }

        if (!accountId.value) {
            router.push('/')
        }
    })
```

And also return statement is returning wallet object, this is done to call ``` wallet.getAccountId()``` to show accountId in ``` /components/Card.vue ```

``` useAuth()``` code :
```
import { watchEffect,ref } from "vue";
import { useRouter } from 'vue-router';
import { wallet, CONTRACT_ID, } from "@/services/near";

const accountId = ref(wallet.getAccountId())

export const useAuth = () => {
    const router = useRouter()

    const handleSignIn = () => {
        // redirects user to wallet to authorize your dApp
        // this creates an access key that will be stored in the browser's local storage
        // access key can then be used to connect to NEAR and sign transactions via keyStore
        wallet.requestSignIn({
            contractId: CONTRACT_ID,
            methodNames: [] // add methods names to restrict access
        })
    }

    const handleSignOut = () => {
        wallet.signOut()
        accountId.value = wallet.getAccountId()
    }

    watchEffect(() => {
        if (accountId.value) {
            router.push('/dashboard')
        }

        if (!accountId.value) {
            router.push('/')
        }
    })

    return {
        wallet,
        accountId,
        signIn: handleSignIn,
        signOut: handleSignOut
    };
}
```

To work with sample--art-demo contract separate ```useArtDemo()``` function is created with Composition API to split the logic. Contract is loaded inside  ``` /services/near.js:```
```
export const CONTRACT_ID = process.env.VUE_APP_CONTRACT_ID;
const gas = new BN(process.env.VUE_APP_gas);

// connecting to NEAR
export const near = new Near({
  networkId: process.env.VUE_APP_networkId,
  keyStore: new keyStores.BrowserLocalStorageKeyStore(),
  nodeUrl: process.env.VUE_APP_nodeUrl,
  walletUrl: process.env.VUE_APP_walletUrl,
});

//create wallet connection
export const wallet = new WalletConnection(near, "NCD.L2.sample--art-demo");

function getContract() {
  return new Contract(
    wallet.account(), // the account object that is connecting
    CONTRACT_ID, // name of contract you're connecting to
    {
      viewMethods: ['getTempDesign', 'viewMyDesign'], // view methods do not change state but usually return a value
      changeMethods: ['design', 'claimMyDesign', 'burnMyDesign'] // change methods modify state
    }
  )
}

const contract = getContract()
```

and export function is created for each contract method

example of a call with no params: 
```
//function to get all messages from thanks contract
export const getMessages = async () => {
    return await thanksContract.list()
}
```

example of call with params (VIEW Method)
```
//function to get user claimed design
export const getMyClaimedDesign = async (accountId) => {
  return await contract.viewMyDesign({ accountId: accountId })
}

```

example of call with params (CHANGE Method)
```
//function to claim generated design and save it as yours design
export const claimDesign = async (seed) => {
  return await contract.claimMyDesign(
    { seed: seed },
    gas
  )
}

```

Then in ```composables/near.js``` all logic from ```services/near.js``` is imported: 
```
import {
    wallet,
    getTempDesign,
    getMyClaimedDesign,
    generateDesign,
    claimDesign,
    burnDesign,
} from "@/services/near";
```

and it is used to store some state of contract and to call contracts methods from services layer: 
```
const generatedDesign = ref(null)
const myDesign = ref(null)
const isLoading = ref(false)
const err = ref(null)

export const useArtDemo = () => {

    const handleGetTempDesign = async (accountId) => {
        return await getTempDesign(accountId)
    }

    const handleGetMyClaimedDesign = async (accountId) => {
        return await getMyClaimedDesign(accountId)
    }

    const handleGenerateDesign = async (accountId) => {
        await generateDesign()
        generatedDesign.value = await getTempDesign(accountId)
    }

    const handleClaimDesign = async (seed) => {
        await claimDesign(seed).then(res => console.log(res), res => console.log(res))
        myDesign.value = await getMyClaimedDesign(wallet.getAccountId())
    }

    const handleBurnDesign = async () => {
        await burnDesign()
        myDesign.value = null
    }

    return {
        isLoading,
        generatedDesign,
        myDesign,
        err,
        getTempDesign:handleGetTempDesign,
        getMyClaimedDesign: handleGetMyClaimedDesign,
        generateDesign: handleGenerateDesign,
        claimDesign: handleClaimDesign,
        burnDesign: handleBurnDesign
    }
}
```

Inside ``` views/Home.vue ``` only ``` signIn() ``` function is imported and passed as props to child component. No additional logic of smart contract is used on Home page:
```
export default {
    components: { Card, HomeFooter },
    setup() {
        const { signIn } = useAuth();
        return {
            signIn
        };
    }
}
...
//passing as a prop to child component
<Card :signIn="signIn"/>
```

Inside ```/views/Dashboard.vue``` lifecycle hook ``` onBeforeMount() ``` is used, inside hook all the data is received from the smart contract with ``` useArtDemo()```  function
```
setup() {
      setup() {
        const { accountId, signOut } = useAuth();
        const { generatedDesign, myDesign, getTempDesign, getMyClaimedDesign, generateDesign, claimDesign, burnDesign, isLoading } = useArtDemo();
        const toast = useToast()

        onBeforeMount(async () => {
            isLoading.value = true
            generatedDesign.value = await getTempDesign(accountId.value)
            if (generatedDesign.value === null) {
                await generateDesign(accountId.value)
            }
            myDesign.value = await getMyClaimedDesign(accountId.value)
            isLoading.value = false
        })

        async function handleGenerateDesign() {
            try {
                isLoading.value = true
                await generateDesign(accountId.value)
            } catch (error) {
                toast.error("Error while generating new design")
            }
            isLoading.value = false
        }

        async function handleClaimDesign() {
            if (myDesign.value) {
                toast.error("You can have only 1 design claimed. First burn you already claimed design, to be able to claim new one")
            } else {
                try {
                    isLoading.value = true
                    await claimDesign(generatedDesign.value.seed)
                } catch (error) {
                    const errorMessage = error?.kind?.ExecutionError
                    toast.error(errorMessage.slice(0, errorMessage.match(', filename').index))
                }
            }
            isLoading.value = false
        }

        async function handleBurnDesign() {
            try {
                isLoading.value = true
                await burnDesign()
            } catch (error) {
                const errorMessage = error?.kind?.ExecutionError
                toast.error(errorMessage.slice(0, errorMessage.match(', filename').index))
            }
            isLoading.value = false
        }

        return {
            accountId,
            signOut,
            handleGenerateDesign,
            myDesign,
            generatedDesign,
            handleClaimDesign,
            handleBurnDesign,
            isLoading
        }
```

Then it is passing all values and functions which are used inside each child component as a props :
```
    <left-side-dashboard :accountId="accountId" :signOut="signOut" />
```
